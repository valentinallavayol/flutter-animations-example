    'Joker is a 2019 American psychological thriller film directed and produced'
    ' by Todd Phillips, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scott Silver. The '
    'film, based on DC Comics characters, stars Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker.'
    ' Joker provides a possible origin story for the character; set in 1981,'
    ' it follows Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian whose descent into'
    ' insanity and nihilism inspires a violent countercultural revolution'
    ' against the wealthy in a decaying Gotham City. Robert De Niro,'
    ' Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy, Brett Cullen, Glenn Fleshler, Bill Camp,'
    ' Shea Whigham, and Marc Maron appear in supporting roles. Joker was'
    ' produced by Warner Bros. Pictures, DC Films, and Joint Effort,'
    ' in association with Bron Creative and Village Roadshow Pictures,'
    ' and distributed by Warner Bros.Phillips conceived Joker in 2016 and wrote'
    ' the script with Silver throughout 2017. The two were inspired by 1970s'
    ' character studies and the films of Martin Scorsese (particularly Taxi'
    ' Driver and The King of Comedy), who was initially attached to the project'
    ' as a producer. The graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke (1988) was the'
    ' basis for the premise, but Phillips and Silver otherwise did not look to'
    ' specific comics for inspiration. Phoenix became attached in February 2018'
    ' and was cast that July, while the majority of the cast signed on by'
    ' August. Principal photography took place in New York City, Jersey City,'
    ' and Newark, from September to December 2018. Joker is the first'
    ' live-action'
    ' theatrical Batman film to receive an R-rating from the'
    ' Motion Picture Association of America, due to its violent and disturbing'
